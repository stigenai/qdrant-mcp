# Cleanup Log

## Files Removed

### Requirements Files (replaced by pyproject.toml)
- `requirements.txt` - Main dependencies list
- `requirements-runtime.txt` - Runtime-only dependencies  
- `requirements-test.txt` - Test dependencies
- `pytest.ini` - Pytest configuration (now in pyproject.toml)

### Configuration Files (replaced by Hydra conf/)
- `config/` directory - Old configuration structure
  - `config/config.example.yaml`
  - `config/config.production.yaml`
- `generate_config.py` - Config generation script (obsolete with Hydra)

### Empty Directories
- `tests/fixtures/` - Empty test fixtures directory

### Cache Files
- All `__pycache__/` directories
- All `*.pyc` files

## Files Kept

### Hooks Directory
- `hooks/requirements.txt` - Kept because hooks are standalone scripts

### Config Module  
- `config.py` - Kept for backward compatibility with existing tests

### Docker and Build Files
- All Docker-related files are updated to use uv
- `build-secure.sh` - Security-focused build script

## Migration Notes

1. All Python dependencies are now managed through `pyproject.toml`
2. Configuration is managed through Hydra with files in `conf/`
3. Use `uv` for all package management operations
4. Run `make install-dev` to set up development environment
5. Run `make help` to see all available commands
